1. Describe state.

State represents the parts of the app that can hold data rendered to the DOM.

Parameter(s) that get passed into a component that's part of a js object.
Also always remember whether you declare a componentÂ as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props


2. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Anything that effects something outside the scope of the function
The useEffect hook is used to manage those side effects
